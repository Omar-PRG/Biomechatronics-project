In this repository i talk about my biomechatronics project
------------------------------------------------------------
The  main advantage of the GuideCane is to help users navigate safely and quickly  among obstacles and other hazards by using three 
ultrasonic sensors that keep finding a free path along the way and if the user is close to an obstacle , it will tell alert him by 
setting  the vibromotor  digital output to one depending on which direction the obstacle appears and the buzzer will fire.  Also the 
user can call for rescue by pressing a button that will send a message that contains his location to a specific sim card either if
any of the sensors stopped working properly or in case of danger.
